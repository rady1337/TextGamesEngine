1) Each line in the .txt file must be numbered starting from 0, so the first line will be numbered 0, the second line will be numbered 1, and so on. 

2) after the line number you need to put "--", it should look like "0--text" 

3) After "--" you need to start writing the text that should be there without a space(in the same version, specify the options for the move, if they are not, then do not specify). 

4) If you have the option, after the text write " if " and then write on which line will move the program in the variant, it should look something like "0--text 1) Exit 2) Hello if 1 3" 

5) If the player has no need to choose, after the text write "next" and the line number where the program goes, it should look like this "0--text 5 next". 

6) If, after executing this line the program ends, you should write "exit" after the text, it should look something like "5--You win!! Thanks for playing exit", then the program will finish its work after this line.

Path to the .txt file "txt/file.txt".

Example:

0--Hello, Its my first text game! next 1
1--You have to get out of the maze next 2
2--Menu next 3
3--1) Start 2) Exit if 5 4 
4--Thanks for playing!!! exit
5--1) Right 2) Left if 6 7
6--You win! next 4
7-- next 5
